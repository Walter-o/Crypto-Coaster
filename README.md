# Crypto-Coaster
Decryption / encryption tool for groove coaster mobile

Currently features:
- AES 256 CBC Encryption / Decryption
- Various hardcoded passwords

edit: Adding Pak file decryption soon, credits to Luigi for the quickbms script
edit2: I will try adding Pak encryption as well so we can mod stuff into the game

Yeah that's it currently. I'm working pretty hard on finding a way to open those darn .pak files. It's really hard.

Also if your a wandering gc player looking for the zip password 
for the bgm/shot/chart zip files, the password is eiprblFFv69R83J5
